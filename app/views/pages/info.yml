bio:
  - "Hi there! My name is Thomas Baird and I was born, raised, and am currently living in Alexandria, VA. 
  I am a 24 year old software engineer with a strong passion for building great software, especially with Ruby 
  and Ruby on Rails."
  - "Alexandria may be where I call home, but after high school I chose to attend the University of Mary 
  Washington (UMW) in Fredericksburg, VA. I had an amazing experience in my 4 years at UMW. I met a ton of great people that 
  I'm sure will be life long friends, I learned a lot of lessons (both in and out of the classroom), and ultimately discovered 
  my passion for computer science and the art of coding."
  - "I still remember my first CS course as clear as day. <a href='http://cs.umw.edu/~stephen//'>Stephen Davies</a> 
  was my professor and <a href='https://www.r-project.org/'>R</a> was the language that we were focusing on for the semester 
  (I know that's an interesting language for beginners). I was fascinated the day I ran my very first program and I still 
  find myself fascinated today with my experiences in the tech/development world."
  - "Anyways, I currently work for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in Washington, DC.
  I have worked there since 2015, and I currently support the agency as a software engineer.
  I love the team I work with and the projects we work on. It's nice to
  work on things that have a (hopefully positive) effect on the country and world."
