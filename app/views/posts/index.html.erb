  <p class="lead text-center">Throughout the posts on here, you will find blurbs about an array of different topics. This is because there are many things in my life that I find interesting, and/or things that I wish when I first encountered them, that I would have had some help with. I do not claim to be a genius. In fact I am no such thing. But I am very passionate about a lot of things. One of which is helping others when I have the opportunity to do so. So don't take the words I write as the <i>be-all and end-all</i> of what I talk about. I'm just putting my thoughts and experiences out on the web. And if just one person finds some benefit from it, then I've done my job.</p>
